    <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>My name is Elliot Chhin, student number s3916911, s3916911@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born here in Victoria but my parents are Cambodian. I don’t follow any religions. I graduated highschool in 2020 and I primarily speak English. I can speak a little of Khmer, Cambodia’s native language, however I sound like a badly translated movie dub.
I have a white cat named Civi who we rescued as a kitten from our garden 2 years ago where she was skinny, filthy, flea and parasite ridden, and sunburnt. Nowadays she’s a chubby, spoiled cat who always wants to go out on walks. I also have a fishpond with a whole bunch of goldfish swimming around.
In my freetime I enjoy playing video games of which are, but not limited to fps games, indie’s, rogue likes and RPG’s. The problem though is that games are a huge time sink and nothing productive gets done, so I’ve been weaning myself off of them and replacing the time spent with drawing instead.
